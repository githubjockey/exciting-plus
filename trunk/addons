+ execution timing based on the omp_get_wtime() for main thread
+ nearest neighbours output to NN.OUT
+ eigenvectors are stored in memory and saved only once afrer SCF cycle 
+ complex charge density 2D plot (task 262)
+ for 2D plot plane definition changed from three corners to origin and two vectors
+ dos in eV and splitted to l and spin channels
+ band character in real spherical harmonics
+ DFT scf loop moved to separate file
+ alternative way to plot bands
